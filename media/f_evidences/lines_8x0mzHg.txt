You may not be her first, her last or her only. She loved before or she may love again. But if she loves you now, what else mattters? She's not perfect, you aren't either. The two of you may never be perfect together but if she can make you laugh, cause you to think twice and admit to being human and making mistakes hold on to her and give her the most you can. She may not be thinking about you every second of the day, but she will give you a part of her that she knows you can break - her Heart. So don't hurt her, don't change her, don't analyze and don't expect more than she can give. Smile when she makes you happy, let her know when she makes you mad and miss her when she's not there. 


We always hear or read about a perfect relationships or ways for having a perfect relationship or many more. But the real scenario behind all this is different and we all know about it. It's absolutely okay if we don't vibe with our partner but it's not okay if we don't put an effort to. Every relationship has some problems but what make them work is love only. We don't have to ask ourselves too much of it, just putting some efforts with love and we will find all vibes that we want, some things are just in our minds.
